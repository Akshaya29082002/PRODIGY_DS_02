# PRODIGY_DS_02
Description: Task 2 involved performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of my choice. I selected a TITANIC dataset. Using Python and libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, I conducted various data cleaning operations such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats. Additionally, I performed EDA to explore relationships between variables, visualize distributions, and uncover insights into the dataset.

Key Insights:

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to ensure data quality and consistency.
Explored correlations between different features and identified potential predictors.
Visualized key statistics and distributions to understand the dataset's characteristics better.
